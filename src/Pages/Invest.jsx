As such, we would like to provide you with why we are the most optimal coffee brand.</p>

                    <p className="mb-6">Every year, 50 billion coffee cups are wasted in the United States alone. This waste goes to the parks and forests we take our leisure in, the waters we drink, the cities we live in, and the land other animals survive in. Being a business built on community, we believe we should do our part in resolving such a crisis, and as such, we’ve developed a set of reusable stainless steel cups, each clad with their own unique artistic design. By primarily utilizing these cups, we can eliminate a majority of the disposable needs of each shop, which is not only an overhead cost, but also must be outsourced, meaning that pollution is made via transportation and manufacturing as well. Contrary to how most climate change initiatives worsen the experience of the customer, like the flimsy  these cups instead better the experience, as they not only have a reusable cup, but one that provides benefits through our stores, such as a slight discount of 5%. While 5% may be a miniscule number, it very much stacks up over time, especially considering that coffee is a frequent purchase for many. As such, these cups can act as a major component of our brand loyalty. </p>
                    <p className="mb-6">However, the potential for these cups lie not only in customer retention, but also for marketing. Whereas our marketing is limited to the service radius of our physical locations, these cups can be shipped internationally in the near future (currently only available in the US and Canada), and allow us to develop a substantial presence in these markets even before we lay the first store in said regions. Not only that, but we can extensively market the release of new series of these cup designs, with each of these series having a unique theme to it (like street art or a cultural style). If done properly, these cups can act as a bit of a fashion statement or component of their identity and expression of self, a common theme with our target audience: young, aspiring adults. </p>
                    <p className="mb-6">In essence, our reusable cups hold great value in various departments, whether it be for retaining customer loyalty, differentiating ourselves from the competition, and preserving our environments.
